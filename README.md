# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
  The focus of this project is to create visualizations of rideshare data for a company named Pyber. 
  
## Goal:

  We aim to improve access to ride-sharing services and we hope to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We
  will utilize the Python graphing library Matplodlib to truly visualize the data in order to make informed decisions.

## Resources:
  -Data Source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv -Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Analaysis
  -As anticipated, there are many more rides in the urban locations, but unlike expected, the average fares are disproportionately 
   more expensive for Rural and Suburban drivers. This is quite apparent looking at the dataframe of deliverable 1.
   
  -This new analysis is exploring the differences between city types through the lens of ride-sharing. 
   
  -The total number of fares is relatively low at the beginning of the year, likely due to winter weather and travel conditions. Even
   with the early year lull, there isn't a large amount of fluctuation in total fares from week to week. This is viewable on the chart below:

## Challenges
  -The most challenging part of this project was the actual problem solving in the coding. I really spent a lot of time going back through 
   all the small parts of this code to understand the logic. Spending that much time has truly allowed me to understand Python better. I feel
   much more confident now.

## Recommendations
  -My recommendations are:
     -Dive further into the details. Unsure why we would limit ourselves to data only between January and April. A full analysis will reveal more
      data on the weekly flucuations, which could allow redistribution of resources on a quarterly, or even potentially monthly basis. 
     -Move more drivers from the city to the suburbs and rural areas. There were more drivers than rides in the urban area, which of course has an 
      impact on the average fare, which I assume we'd like to increase.
